This folder holds the hero media used by the site.

Replace these placeholders with your own files:
- hero.mp4 — short, muted loop video suitable for background hero.
- hero.jpg — poster/fallback image for browsers or when video fails.

Tip: keep the video small (<5–10 MB), muted, and with a loop‑friendly cut.
